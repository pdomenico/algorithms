This repo contains the code I've written while studying algorithm design, in particular:
- Code from programming assignments and exercises from Tim Roughgarden's course on algorithms (in the course/ directory)
- Problems from leetcode
- The other folders are my own implementation of certain algorithms I wanted to exercise
